Net Skip is the App Fair's free and open-source web browser. It presents a minimal and tasteful browsing experience, resulting in the fastest web browsing experience available on any mobile device, anywhere.

In contrast with most other browsers on the market, Net Skip is best characterized by what it does *not* feature:

  • No embedded advertising or tracking
  • No cryptocurrency features
  • No rewards programs
  • No in-app purchases or subscriptions
  • No telemetry, analytics, or user data collection
  • No monetization whatsoever of the user of the app
